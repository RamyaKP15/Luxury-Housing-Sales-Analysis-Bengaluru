# Luxury Housing Sales Analysis â€“ Bengaluru

**Sales Analysis Dashboard for Luxury Housing in Bengaluru**

---

## Problem Statement
Build a complete real estate analytics solution using Python for advanced data cleaning, load the refined dataset into a SQL database, and use Power BI to directly connect to SQL and build a dashboard. The goal is to replicate a real-world enterprise-level data pipeline and analysis environment using a complex housing dataset with 1,00,000+ records.

---

## Overview

Raw datasets often contain missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and outliers.  
This project demonstrates systematic **data cleaning and preprocessing** techniques to transform messy data into a reliable and structured format ready for analysis through Power BI.

---

## Objectives
- Handle **missing values** (imputation with mean/median/mode, group-based filling).
- Remove **duplicates** and irrelevant data.
- Standardize **date and numeric formats**.
- Correct **inconsistent text entries** (case formatting, stripping whitespace, removing special characters).
- Detect and handle **outliers**.
- Ensure the dataset is ready for **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** or **machine learning pipelines**.
